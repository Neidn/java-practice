One particular mismatch that I encounter every now and then is a lot more than problematic: it can be outright dangerous. This is the mismatch between URL-based filtering in various security frameworks and view-based navigation in Vaadin. If you only remember one thing from this post, let it be that access control for Vaadin views must be based on the actual Vaadin views, and not only on the URL. Keep reading to learn why that is, and what a safe solution looks like.","title":"The dangers of using the wrong abstraction for Vaadin access control","draft":"false","imageUrl":"https:\/\/website.vaadin.com\/hubfs\/Blog\/access-control\/vaadin-checks.jpg","linkUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/blog\/the-dangers-of-using-the-wrong-abstraction-for-vaadin-access-control","iconUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/documents\/10187\/10395\/tori-icon-blue-bg-90px\/4597dffb-3868-4711-b422-8fc3e71844e6?t=1394217295000","id":"69248","validTo":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z"},{"orFilters":"true","read":"false","linkText":"Read more","notificationType":"5","validFrom":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","body":"&nbsp;  Vaadin was part of GitHub\u2019s Holiday Coding Challenge and we received four magnificent applications from our community.
